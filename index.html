  <p>
    Thank you for visiting us. I hope you enjoy all of the tings that can be found here. On this site, there will be various things that you
    can do. On this site, you will be able to access a secret program that encodes and decodes a message that you input. It is also able to
    send your message to one of your friends, but no one else would know the code!

  <p>
    You will also be able to access a game called Dodge the Fireball, in which your character moves with the arrow keys in order to avoid
    projectile fireballs that will kill you at contact.
    
    I hope you enjoy!
